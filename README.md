<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I've been using my Raspberry Pi 4 as a desktop for a couple of years now but for the most part, it was just collecting dust.
The idea of integrating my Raspberry Pi with robotics has always interested me, but I never made the jump to try it.
After researching a good starting point based on my skill level I decided to go with Freenove's 4WD Smart Car Kit. This kit included everything I needed to get started except for the Raspberry Pi and the 18650 batteries.
The kit included a very detailed tutorial that explained how to build the smart car and the purposes of it's various components. After building the smart car, there is a small introduction into programming it in Python.

In this repository you will find code written for various functionality of the smart car.

I'm currently programming the smart car for line-following. Check out "Line_Tracking.py"!
